			-[After  Hacking]: [1...n][1677]Exploits/[1...n][495]Payloads
				+Choose and configure an target-bugs-based exploit to entre the system [Target]
				+Check if [Target] is suscpetible for this exploit
				+Choose and configure a payload to be executed on [Target], like Remote Shell
				+Choose encoding techniques to remove HEX opcodes from payload which could cause exploit to fail
				+Execute the exploit
